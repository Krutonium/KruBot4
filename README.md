# KruBot4

This project is intended for my own use only, in terms of both development and use. That said, Its source available, not open source. If you want to use this and you're a streamer that does sub 100 viewers, you're free to do so. However, if you're above 100 viewers average, then I would ask you get in contact so I can (A) better serve you and (B) properly license it to you.

Development is Ongoing and happening on Twitch at https://twitch.tv/PFCKrutonium where I play games and do development like this.
